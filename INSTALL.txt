Hello!

To run our code, please first install:
yojson
ANSITerminal
cohttp
lwt
cohttp-lwt-unix
csv

Note: Some of our UI functionalities require a Unix machine.

Note yojson, ANSITerminal, and csv are part of the standard 3110 ocaml switch. 
We installed cohttp and lwt by running this command in terminal:
$ opam install cohttp-lwt-unix cohttp-async
(From https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp)

You'll also then want to run:
$ sudo apt-get install -y libgmp-dev  


Once you've got all our dependencies, just type
$ make run

Note: you might need to do make build, delete "main.byte", and do make run again... or at least we had to do that a few times

And follow our UI instructions! (Yes -> current price -> ....)

If you would like to see some cool functionality, wait 1-2 minutes between "current price" and "quit".
